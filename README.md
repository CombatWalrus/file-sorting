- Find min search on file dates. (Testing with smaller folder first)
- Output results to indexable txt / csv file. (Ordered by year created - 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014)
- Move files [bar this year?] to the correct folders.
- Find duplicate file names and create indexable txt / csv. (Hold them for review, giving priority to later dates.)

- Create a UI from which to run the script.
